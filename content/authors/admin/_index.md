My name is Yuchen Lu. I am currently a P.hD. candidate at the [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) lab of University of Montreal, supervised by [Prof. Aaron Courville](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=km6CP8cAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that I received my undergraduate degree at [UIUC](http://cs.illinois.edu/) working with [Prof. Jian Peng](http://jianpeng.web.engr.illinois.edu/). I was also an undergrad at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

**My fundamental research interest is language learning as systematic generalization.**
Humans are able to generate unseen novel utterances from a limited sample of data, while current machine learning approaches fall short on. Building an intelligent agent that is able to acquire the language as efficient as humans is the important next step as we are seeing the marginal effect of increasing model size of language models.
I believe there are two main missing pieces of puzzles: 

1) Humans learn the language in an embodied environment, and humans acquire language as a tool to influence the world around them. We should model [situated language learning](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED556704.pdf) beyond learning from a static corpus.

2) Language evolves and adapts to an [iterated transmission process](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/IteratedLearningEvolutionLanguage.pdf) so that it becomes structured and easy-to-acquire for the later generations. We should model this cultural evolution aspect of language in our language learning.


I enjoying seeing the impact of my research. Recently, our research team, parternered with [WebDip](http://webdiplomacy.net/) successfully developed an AI player for the board game [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)), and it's covered in one of the most popular [podcast channels](https://diplomacygames.com/rise-of-the-bots/) in the community.

I also co-founded [Tuninsight](http://tuinsight.com/), an [award-winning](https://tuninsight.com/news/) Montreal-based start-up.
